Given that this project's goal is to illustrate logging separation in
presence of shared libraries located on a shared class path, the
following artifacts must be placed in the common class path of your
web-server. 

Assuming your web-server is Tomcat 6, place following files

  shared-1.0.jar   // the shared library built by this project
  slf4j-api-1.5.11.jar
  logback-core-0.9.19.jar
  logback-classic-0.9.19.jar

under $TOMCAT6_HOME/lib.

The shared-1.0.jar artifact can be obtained by building this project,
that is by launching the 'mvn package' command.

To add yoda and kebobi to your web-app, add the following to your
Tomcat server's conf/server.xml file under the appropriate <host>:

    <Context docBase="some_path../logback-starwars/kenobi/target/kenobi" 
                path="/kenobi"/>

    <Context docBase="some_path.../logback-starwars/yoda/target/yoda" 
                path="/yoda"/>

where "some_path..." the folder containing the logback-starwars
project.

Enabling ContextJNDISelector
============================

To enable ContextJNDISelector you need to add 

  JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dlogback.ContextSelector=JNDI"

to Tomcat's catalina.sh script.
